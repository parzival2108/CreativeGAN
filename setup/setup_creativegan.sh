# Bash script to set up an anaconda python-based deep learning environment
# that has support for pytorch and needed dependencies.  It assumes that
# you have (mini)conda installed.

# This should not require root.  However, it does copy and build a lot of
# binaries into your ~/.conda directory.  If you do not want to store
# these in your homedir disk, then ~/.conda can be a symlink somewhere else.
# (At MIT CSAIL, you should symlink ~/.conda to a directory on NFS or local
# disk instead of leaving it on AFS, or else you will exhaust your quota.)

# Start from parent directory of script
cd "$(dirname "$(dirname "$(readlink -f "$0")")")"
